## Documentation

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System architecture and domain modules
- `docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md` — Business goals, user types, MVP scope
- `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` — Engineering, security, and operations rules
- `docs/TECH_STACK_2026.md` — Recommended stack and version posture
- `docs/UI_STANDARD.md` — Shared UI standards and design tokens
- `docs/MAC_SETUP.md` — macOS setup and diagnostics

Each subfolder contains its own `README.md` with deeper setup, environment overrides, and testing instructions.

## API Security

- `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/api/v1/auth/login` are public
- All other routes require Keycloak bearer token
- Actor identity from JWT `sub` — request bodies never carry actor IDs
- Swagger UI at `http://localhost:4000/api/docs` (enabled in dev)
- Spring Data JPA owns application persistence; Flyway applies the single initial baseline and future versioned schema upgrades at API startup.
